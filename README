ActsAsPhoto
===========

Allows a model to have an attached photo (per record/instance).
When a photo is saved to the model, the original photo file is placed
in the specified path, along with several resized versions, based
on the specified sizes (see below).

Only JPEG images are supported at this time.

Requirements
------------

* ImageMagick
* MiniMagick (*not* RMagick)
